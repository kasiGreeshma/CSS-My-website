            I have 5years of experience in designing.
            I am web developer, programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client, and any general-purpose programming language in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client and server.
